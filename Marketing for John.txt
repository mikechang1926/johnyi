-- The concept is a John Yi twitter bot, like Trump.
	* Engage when sign up (get as much voter info)
	* Engage when there's a nearby event
	* Engage when haven't for a while
	* Engage to attract more volunteers
	* Engage when there's crucial times (voting or fundraising)
-- Fundraising is to come but is to be rallied later. No need to advertise for this as there's always a chance down the line. Other donators can go on website.

Web presence
-- Photos and stops of you actually being in the community and appealing to votes of other demographics. Create a mature appeal.
Email campaign
Launch: 
	Phase 1;
	- Gathering contacts and looking into data (gather mailing address, name etc and voter info)
	Phase 2: The hype building
	- Blanket the city with some ad spend (if we have it)
	- Drum up writers ready to go with an embargo
	Phase 2.5: Announcement (fundraising)
	Phase 3: Targetted fb ads, targetted snail mail, targetted SMS. Key is SAME time.

Nurturing
	-SMS drip campaigning
	-Email drip campaigning
	- Build loyalty: Small games (trivia for engagement), // gamify things to read and to do on the website. (strengthen community by exclusiveness)
